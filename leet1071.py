# LeetCode Problem 1071
# https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings
# For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t
#    (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
# Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

class Solution:
    def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        #code

        return "result"
    

commonDivisor = Solution()

print(commonDivisor.gcdOfStrings("ABCABC", "ABC"))
