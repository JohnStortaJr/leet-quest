LeetCode problem [2215](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays)

Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list answer of size 2 where:

* answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
* answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.

_Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order._

**Example**

`nums1` = [1,2,3]

`nums2` = [2,4,6]

`difference` = [[1,3],[4,6]]
