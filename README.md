## Python implementations of LeetCode problems
The problems are organized according to the [**NeetCode roadmap**](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).

Not every NeetCode problem in the roadmap directly corresponds to a LeetCode problem.

_For Example_, NeetCode's [Duplicate Integer](https://neetcode.io/problems/duplicate-integer) problem aligns with LeetCode's [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate) problem, though there are slight differences. The intention is to use the NeetCode roadmap as the guide to focus on the important patterns, but solve the problem as defined by LeetCode. Ideally, the solutions will work for both problems.

* Problems prefixed with an `z` are not part of the NeetCode roadmap, but were completed for additional experience on that topic.
* The `backlog` folder contains problems that have not yet been solved.

### Methodology
Solutions are focused on solving the problem and learning the patterns rather than reducing code or optimizing performance.

I include as many comments within the code as possible to explain my approach and implementation. This makes the code wordy, but easier to refer back to and understand.
