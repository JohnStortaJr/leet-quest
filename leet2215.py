# LeetCode Problem 2215 -- IN PROGRESS
# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays
# Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:
# answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
# answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.
# Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

        return [1,2,3,4]
    

listDifference = Solution()

print(listDifference.findDifference([1,2,3,4], [5,2,4,1,3]))
